# Numbered tabs

A simple chrome extension that adds a number before the tab title.  
Helpful for those who use the keyboard shortcut `âŒ˜ + <num>` to switch between tabs.

## Limitations

It doesn't work for any URLs starting with `chrome://`. Google doesn't give developers permission to modify such pages.
Examples of pages with the `chrome://` URL include the following:
- New tab page
- Extensions page
- Settings page

## Acknolwedgements

This extension is based off the extension [01. Tabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/01-tabs/ennmnifpnkbipkcamokebcjmofhbiiil?hl=en).  
I build this to solve the bugs in that extension.
